Project Overview:

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of LEGO sales data using Power BI to create an interactive and insightful dashboard. The dataset, comprising information on various LEGO sets, including categories, themes, and sales-related details, allowed for a comprehensive exploration of sales trends, top-performing sets, and more.

Problem Statement:

The LEGO company sought a detailed examination of their sales data to better understand trends, identify high-performing themes and sets, and gain insights into customer preferences. The goal was to create a dynamic dashboard that provides actionable insights for decision-makers within the company.


Analysis Highlights:

Sales Trends Over the Years: Utilized a line chart to visualize the overall sales trend, allowing stakeholders to identify growth patterns and potential areas of improvement.

Revenue Distribution Across Themes and Categories: Created donut charts to showcase the distribution of revenue across different LEGO themes and categories, aiding in strategic decision-making for product development and marketing.

Top Sales Performers: Developed column charts highlighting the top 10 sets and themes by sales, enabling quick identification of best-selling products.

Average Age Analysis: Incorporated a column chart to display the average minimum age by category, providing insights into the target demographic for different LEGO sets.

Piece Information Visualization: Utilized an area chart to represent the number of pieces by theme group, aiding in understanding the complexity and variety of LEGO sets.

Average Pieces by Category: Designed a donut chart to illustrate the average number of pieces by category, assisting in product planning and inventory management.

Top Theme Groups by Total Pieces: Implemented a tree map showcasing the top 10 theme groups based on total pieces, helping identify popular themes with a wide variety of components.
